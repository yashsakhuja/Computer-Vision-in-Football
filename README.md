# Player Detection in Football

This repository focuses on detecting players in football using YOLO models, integrating ByteTrack for tracking, and utilizing OpenCV for processing. The project is split into three key phases, documented in the blog series linked below.

## Project Overview
- **Object Detection:** Using YOLO models for detecting players in football footage.
- **Model Training:** Training on annotated datasets from Roboflow.
- **Tracking:** Integrating ByteTrack to track players over time.
- **Computer Vision:** Utilizing OpenCV for image processing and visualization.
